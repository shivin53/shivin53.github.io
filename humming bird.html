    <h2>Facts</h2>
<p>
    Like a crown jewel, a hummingbird nest is one of the great wonders in all of nature. 
    <br>
    They are so tiny, so perfect. Yet, few of us have ever seen a hummingbird nest. 
     <br>
     This is because they are nearly impossible to find. 
      <br>
      From the ground, they look like another bump on a branch. 
<br>
From above, an umbrella of leaves conceals them. 
    <br>
    And from the side, they look like a tiny knot, quilted with lichens, plant down and fibers. 
     <br>
     Though each of the 17 hummingbird species that breed in North America builds slightly different nests in various habitats, all hummingbird nests have much in common.
    <br>
    Hummingbird eggs are about the size of navy beans.
     <br>
     Most females lay two eggs, which they incubate for 15 to 18 days.

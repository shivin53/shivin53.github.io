    <h2>Facts</h2>
<p>
    Our incredible sparrow facts have to start with their ease of viewing!
    <br>
     Sparrows are one of the easiest birds to attract to your backyard.
     <br>
      Birders can encourage visits by putting out well-placed feeders.
      <br>
       They’re even responsive to pishing.
<br>
    Pishing is a way of imitating a bird’s call to attract them.
    <br>
     It’s a useful technique for birders to master.
     <br>
    If the weather is good and there aren’t nearby humans, it’s easy to call for sparrows.
    <br>
     Other birds that respond to pishing include warblers, wrens, kinglets, jays, finches, and chickadees.
     <br>
     A sparrow is a member of the genus Passer. 
     <br>

    <h2>Facts</h2>
    <p>Bears are extraordinarily intelligent animals. They have far superior navigation skills to humans; excellent memories; large brain to body ratio; and use tools in various contexts from play to hunting.
        Bears grieve deeply for others. Cubs are known to moan and cry when separated from their mothers.  This can go on for weeks if their mothers are killed by hunters.
        Bears have excellent senses of smell, sight and hearing. They can smell food, cubs, a mate or predators from miles away. Their great eyesight allows them to detect when fruits are ripe.
        Some species of Asiatic bear build nests in the trees. They can use these for hiding, eating and even sleeping.
        Bears care deeply about family members. They will risk their lives and even fight to the death in order to save a cub or sibling from danger.
        Koalas are not bears. They are marsupials.
        The dawn bear was the first bear. It lived more than 10 million years ago.
        In the north, bears sleep in the winter, but they don’t hibernate. Hibernating animals have a very low temperature. Bears just take a long, long nap. Sometimes they wake up and go out in the winter.
        Bears are related to walruses, seals and sea lions.
        Bears can see color. Not all mammals can.
        Giant Panda are classified as a bear. The giant panda was endangered in the wild but in recent years population has grown slightly and they are now classed as vulnerable.
        Bears have one of the best senses of smell of any mammal. Much better than humans.
        A family or group of bears in called a “sloth”. A male bear is a “boar”, females are called “sows” and babies are “cubs”.
        A polar bear might look white, but that that’s because we only see the white fur, underneath the fur the polar bear actually has black skin.
        The only known predator brave enough to take on a fully grown bear is a tiger. Unfortunately humans also hunt bears.
        Bears are better swimmers than you or I.
        Polar bears are known to be long distant swimmers, they can swim up to 30 miles without stopping. Some researchers say they can actually swim up to 200 miles, yikes. You certainly will not out swim a polar bear.
        Bear claws are similar to dogs, they cannot retract them unlike a cat who can.

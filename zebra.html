    <h2>Facts</h2>
    <p>The most common species is the plains zebra, which roams grasslands and woodland of eastern and southern Africa. The Grevy’s zebra can be found in dry, semi-desert areas of Kenya and Ethiopia, and the mountain zebra lives in mountainous and hilly habitats in Namibia, Angola and South Africa.
        Zebras are social animals and live together in large groups, called herds. As they migrate to new feeding grounds, ‘super herds’ may form consisting of thousands of individuals. They may team up with other grazers on their travels, too, such as antelope and wildebeest.
        Zebras stick together in herds. Within a herd, zebras tend to stay together in smaller family groups. Families are generally made up of a male, several females, and their young.
        As a zebra grazes, it uses its sharper front teeth to bite the grass, and then uses its duller back teeth to crush and grind. A zebra's teeth keep growing for its entire life, because constant grazing and chewing wears them down.
        Zebras are constantly on the move to find fresh grass and water. Sometimes they gather in huge herds of thousands as they migrate to better feeding grounds. They often travel in mixed herds with other grazers and browsers, such as wildebeest.
        Zebras groom one another. If you see two zebras standing close to each other and it looks like they're biting each other, don't worry. They're pulling loose hairs off each other as they groom. Grooming also feels good to a zebra—it's like having an itch scratched.
        The Mountain zebras are represented by two sub-species. These are Cape mountain zebras, inhabiting South Africa; and Hartmann's mountain zebra subspecies, occurring in scattered parts of Namibia, Angola, and South Africa. As the common name of the species suggests, Mountain zebras prefer living on mountainous slopes and plateaus. Meanwhile, the Cape mountain zebra subspecies are found at heights of up to 2,000 m above sea level. During the cold winter months, they migrate to lower elevations. Hartmann’s mountain zebras, on the other hand, constantly move between mountains and salt flats.

   <h2>Facts</h2> 
   <p>Eagles are large, powerfully built birds of prey, with heavy heads and beaks.
     <br>
     Even the smallest eagles, such as the booted eagle (Aquila pennata), which is comparable in size to a common buzzard (Buteo buteo) or red-tailed hawk (B. jamaicensis), have relatively longer and more evenly broad wings, and more direct, faster flight – despite the reduced size of aerodynamic feathers. Most eagles are larger than any other raptors apart from some vultures. The smallest species of eagle is the South Nicobar serpent eagle (Spilornis klossi), at 450 g (0.99 lb) and 40 cm (16 in). The largest species are discussed below. Like all birds of prey, eagles have very large, hooked beaks for ripping flesh from their prey, strong, muscular legs, and powerful talons. The beak is typically heavier than that of most other birds of prey. Eagles' eyes are extremely powerful, having up to 3.6 times human acuity for the martial eagle, which enables them to spot potential prey from a very long distance. This keen eyesight is primarily attributed to their extremely large pupils which ensure minimal diffraction (scattering) of the incoming light. The female of all known species of eagles is larger than the male.
     <br>
    Eagles normally build their nests, called eyries, in tall trees or on high cliffs.
    <br>
     Many species lay two eggs, but the older, larger chick frequently kills its younger sibling once it has hatched.
     <br>
      The dominant chick tends to be a female, as they are bigger than the male.
      <br>
       The parents take no action to stop the killing.
    <br>
    Due to the size and power of many eagle species, they are ranked at the top of the food chain as apex predators in the avian world.
    <br>
     The type of prey varies by genus.
     <br>
      The Haliaeetus and Ichthyophaga eagles prefer to capture fish, though the species in the former often capture various animals, especially other water birds, and are powerful kleptoparasites of other birds.
      <br>
       The snake and serpent eagles of the genera Circaetus, Terathopius, and Spilornis predominantly prey on the great diversity of snakes found in the tropics of Africa and Asia. 
       <br>
       The eagles of the genus Aquila are often the top birds of prey in open habitats, taking almost any medium-sized vertebrate they can catch.
       <br>
        Where Aquila eagles are absent, other eagles, such as the buteonine black-chested buzzard-eagle of South America, may assume the position of top raptorial predator in open areas.
        <br>
        Many other eagles, including the species-rich Spizaetus genus, live predominantly in woodlands and forest.
        <br>
         These eagles often target various arboreal or ground-dwelling mammals and birds, which are often unsuspectingly ambushed in such dense, knotty environments.
         <br>
          Hunting techniques differ among the species and genera, with some individual eagles having engaged in quite varied techniques based their environment and prey at any given time. 
          <br>
        Most eagles grab prey without landing and take flight with it, so the prey can be carried to a perch and torn apart.
        <br>
    The bald eagle is noted for having flown with the heaviest load verified to be carried by any flying bird, since one eagle flew with a 6.8 kg (15 lb) mule deer fawn.
    <br>
     However, a few eagles may target prey considerably heavier than themselves; such prey is too heavy to fly with, thus it is either eaten at the site of the kill or taken in pieces back to a perch or nest.
     <br>
     Golden and crowned eagles have killed ungulates weighing up to 30 kg (66 lb) and a martial eagle even killed a 37 kg (82 lb) duiker, 7–8 times heavier than the preying eagle. Authors on birds David Allen Sibley, Pete Dunne, and Clay Sutton described the behavioral difference between hunting eagles and other birds of prey thus (in this case the bald and golden eagles as compared to other North American raptors):
     <br>
    Among the eagles are some of the largest birds of prey: only the condors and some of the Old World vultures are markedly larger. It is regularly debated which should be considered the largest species of eagle. They could be measured variously in total length, body mass, or wingspan.
    <br>
    Different lifestyle needs among various eagles result in variable measurements from species to species.
    <br>
    For example, many forest-dwelling eagles, including the very large Harpy eagle, have relatively short wingspans, a feature necessary for being able to maneuver in quick, short bursts through densely forested habitats.
    <br>
    Eagles in the genus Aquila, though found almost strictly in open country, are superlative soarers, and have relatively long wings for their size.
    <br>
    Eagles are apex predators, meaning they are at the top of the food chain.
    <br>
    What eagles eat depends upon the species and the food that is available to them, but they are all carnivorous and live on a diet of meat and/or fish.
    <br>
    Eagles can be divided broadly into four groups; sea eagles, booted eagles, snake eagles and giant forest eagles.
    <br>
    Booted eagles have a relatively wide diet consisting of birds, small mammals, reptiles, rodents, amphibians and insects, whereas others are more restricted.
    <br>
    Sea eagles or fish eagles feed mostly on a diet of fish whilst snake eagles specialise on capturing reptiles.
    <br>
    Giant forest eagles feed on various forest animals. 
    <br>
    One of the largest eagles, the Harpy eagle, feeds on larger animals including monkeys, sloths and coatis.

    <h2>Facts</h2>
<p>
    <br>
    Vultures are large birds of prey that usually feed on carrion (dead or dying animals and rocks). 
     <br>
     Vultures use their large wings to soar in the air for many miles without having to flap.
      <br>
      Vultures are also called buzzards.
<br>
Vultures from the Old World (Europe, Asia, and Africa) are not related to the vultures of the New World (North and South America). 
    <br>
    They look quite similar, though. Both have heads and necks with no feathers.
     <br>
     Old World vultures are related to eagles and hawks and use sight to find their food. 
    <br>
    New World vultures are related to storks and use their sense of smell to find their food.
         <br>
     Vultures symbolize death in literature.

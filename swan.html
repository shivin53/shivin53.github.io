    <h2>facts</h2>
    <p>A swan (Cygnini) is a kind of water bird, from the genera Cygnus and Coscoroba.
        <br>
        They are in the subfamily Anserinae, in the family Anatidae, which also includes geese and ducks.
        <br>
Many swans live in colder places, such as northern Europe, Asia and North America.
<br>
They live on water. 
<br>
They swim on top of the water and eat plants off the bottom of ponds, lakes, or oceans.
<br>
They also eat insects and other small animals.
<br>
Swans can also fly.
<br>
Swans are the largest extant members of the waterfowl family Anatidae, and are among the largest flying birds. 
<br>
The uniqueness of swans makes them identifiable among other birds. 
<br>
If you are not a traveler, you might not know about black swans because they are not everywhere.
<br>
The citizens of Australia, New Zealand, and a few countries can relate to this.

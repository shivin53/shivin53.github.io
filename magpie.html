    <h2>Facts</h2>
<p>
    <br>
    The magpie is a large bird in the crow family, Corvidae.
     <br>
     It is a general scavenger and predator of insects, small mammals, and other birds' eggs and young.
     <br>
     The word "magpie" usually means the European magpie (Pica pica), which is a very common bird. 
<br>
There are other magpies in Europe, in Spain and Portugal. 
    <br>
    Elsewhere, there are other species of magpie. 
     <br>
     Some are black and white and are in the genus Pica. 
    <br>
    Some are green and blue and are also known as "oriental" magpies (Genus Urocissa and Cissa).
         <br>
         There is also one species of blue and white magpie, the azure-winged magpie Cyanopica cyana.

<h2>Facts</h2>
<p>Parrots comprise 398 species of the order Psittaciformes and are commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Australia, Central and South America, and Africa.
     However, some parrots do live outside tropical environments. The Kea is the world’s only parrot to inhabit the alpine climates of New Zealand, nesting in the roots of trees.
     Its thick feathers and rounded body help to conserve body heat, making it possible to live in cold environments, specifically high up in the mountains.
  <br>
  It is no surprise that many species of parrot can talk.
  We’ve often seen this in movies, and it’s not just some prank. The parrots can mimic human words, but their sophisticated communication skills may influence them.
  If you have a parrot, then there is every tendency that it’s likely to pick up certain words and phrases that you often say, such as ‘Hello.’
  <br>
  Parrots are birds of the order Psittaciformes. 
  here are roughly 372 species in 86 genera and they are found in most tropical and subtropical regions. 
  The greatest diversity of parrots is found in South America and Australasia.

    <h2>Facts</h2>
<p>Variable in color, but most birds are bluish gray with two black bands on the wing and a black tip to the tail. 
    <br>
    Most birds have iridescent throat feathers. 
    <br>
    Wing patterns may include two bars, dark spots, or can be plain.
    <br>
    The tail is usually dark tipped.
    <br>
    Pigeons often gather in flocks, walking or running on the ground and pecking for food.
    <br>
    When alarmed, the flock may suddenly fly into the air and circle several times before coming down again.
<br>
Pigeons are familiar birds of cities and towns. 
<br>
You'll also see them around farmland and fields, as well as in their archetypal habitat, rocky cliffs.

    <h2>Facts</h2>
   <p>Indian peafowl are a species in a group of birds called pheasants.
    <br> 
    males are called peacocks, while the females are called peahens.
    <br>
    Together, they are peafowl.
    <br>
    Peafowl are among the largest of all birds that fly. 
    <br>
    (Ostriches, emus, and other such birds are bigger, but cannot fly.)
    <br>
    The beautiful feathers that cover the tails of a peacock are 5 feet (1.5 meters) long—longer than the bird's body—and can be displayed in a spectacular fan of brilliant colors.
<br>
These long feathers actually grow from the bird's back not the tail.
<br>
He elevates them by raising the much shorter tail feathers underneath them.
<br>
Peahens are more drab than their male counterparts, with mostly brown on their back with a white belly.
<br>
Females don't have long tail feathers, but they do have a crest on their head and green neck feathers.

        <h2>Facts<h2>
        <p>These cats are nimble at high speeds, able to make quick and sudden turns in pursuit of prey. Cheetahs’ bodies are uniquely adapted to help them reach top speeds, from their long, slender limbs and hard foot pads to the flexible spine that gives them their long stride.

            Cheetahs are famous for their tawny coats covered in black spots, each arranged in a unique pattern to help the animals identify one another. Bold black stripes streak like tears from the inner corners of their eyes down to both sides of their mouths, and the ends of their bushy tails have black rings.
            
            The cheetah's excellent eyesight helps it find prey during the day. The cheetah is hard to see because its spotted coat blends with the tall, dry grass of the plains. 
            
          And Cheetahs eat small- to medium-size animals, such as hares, impalas, wildebeest calves, and gazelles. 

          Because of their size, strength, and predatory skills, some scientists consider cheetahs to be one of the “big cats.” Tigers, lions, leopards, and jaguars are also part of this grouping. Unlike the rest of the group, cheetahs can’t roar, though they can they purr.
          
          Although they typically prefer open grasslands, cheetahs live in a range of habitats across eastern and southern Africa. 
          
          Once found throughout Asia and Africa, cheetahs today are racing toward extinction. Loss of habitat and declining numbers of their prey combine to threaten the future of these cats.
